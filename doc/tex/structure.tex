\chapter{General structure of the code}

The code is divided in several libraries. Each library implements one ore more classes designed to
handle one particular aspect of the calculation. 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf matrix}. Matrix algebra.
\item {\bf numdiff}. Implements Gauss-Legendre and multi-domain Gauss-Lobatto
numerical differentiation.
\item {\bf mapping}. Defines the mapping in spheroidal coordinates $r(\zeta,\theta)$. 
\item {\bf solver}. Resolution of systems of linear differential equations in 2D.
\item {\bf physics}. Calculation of physical quantities (opacity, equation of state, nuclear reaction rates).
\item {\bf star}. Provides objects and functions to calculate the structure of a star in 1D and 2D.
\item {\bf global}. Definition of global variables, e.g. physical and mathematical constants.
\item {\bf graphics}. Provides graphical output through {\tt pgplot}.
\item {\bf parser}. Parsing of configuration files and command-line arguments and file input/output.
\end{itemize}
